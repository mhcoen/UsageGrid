   - Provider Name: "OpenAI"
   - Cost: "$XX.XX" (updates in real-time if API key is valid)

   - Status: "Active" (green), "Waiting..." (gray), or "Error" (red)

### With Mock Data
If you run `test_with_mock_data.py`, the OpenAI card should show:
- Cost: Random value between $10.00 - $50.00
- Tokens: Random value between 10,000 - 100,000
- Status: "Active" in green

### Without API Key
If no OPENAI_API_KEY is set:
- Cost: "$0.00"
- Tokens: "Tokens: -"
- Status: "Waiting..." in gray

### Interaction
- Hovering over a card: Background changes to light gray, border thickens
- Clicking a card: Shows a popup with current details and "Detailed views coming soon!"

### Status Bar
Bottom of window shows current status:
- "Real-time polling active" when running normally
- Error messages if issues occur

## Current State

The async version successfully:
1. Creates the UI with all provider cards
2. Runs a worker thread for async polling
3. Updates the display every second
4. Shows mock data when no real API key is present

The OpenAI adapter is implemented but the actual API endpoint might need adjustment for real usage data.
